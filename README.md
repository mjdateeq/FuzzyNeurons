# FuzzyNeurons
Python Codes for Fuzzy AND\OR Neurons

Logic-driven AND\OR neurons are computaionally different than digital AND\OR gates.
However, They are also interesting generalizations of the basic logic gates encountered in digital system design


Tp get a better understanding of what Fuzzy AND\OR neurons are, I suggest looking at the follwoing references:
[1] K. Hirota and W. Pedrycz, “OR/AND neuron in modeling fuzzy set connectives,” IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Systems, vol. 2, pp. 151–161, May 1994.
[2] M. Alateeq, and W. Pedrycz, "Development of two-phase logic-oriented fuzzy AND/OR network", Neurocomputing, Volume 482, 14 April 2022, Pages 129-138

This codes for implementing Fuzzy logic oriented AND\OR neurons
The operations are implemented using t-norm and t-conorm


Algebraic Product (a t b = ab)
Probabilistic Sum (a s b = a + b - ab)
